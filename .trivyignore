# Instructions: add rules here to skip reporting vulnerabilities that are not
# relevant to the runtime environment. The rules are based on the CVE ID.
# The CVE IDs can be found in the Trivy scan output.
#
# For every vulnerability that you want to skip, please include the following
# information:
# - Package: the name of the package reported by Trivy
# - Vulnerability: description of the vulnerability as reported by Trivy
# - Reference: a URL that provides more information about the vulnerability
# - Reason: why the vulnerability is not relevant to the runtime environment
#
# NOTE: vulnerabilities that haven't been fixed yet should not be ignored here
# because they are filtered out globally by Trivy. This file is only for
# vulnerabilities with available fixes.
#
